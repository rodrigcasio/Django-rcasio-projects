# Django rcasio projects
These are just projects I create while learning Django

## if want to work on a existing project.. Set up correctly the **.venv**, **activate it**, and **install dependencies needed**.

**Within the project/ directory:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```


All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` *(These are also needed for docker to containerize an app)

(don't forget to delete `.venv` directory after finishing project, to avoid consuming disk space in local machine)
